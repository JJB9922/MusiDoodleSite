      v0.0.1 is the first version of MusiDoodle. It is a prototype, and is not intended for use in production.
      It is possible to put something together in it, but it is not recommended to use it for anything important.
      You cannot save or load tracks. You cannot export tracks. You cannot share tracks. You cannot collaborate on tracks.
      You cannot even change the name of a track. You can only create a track, and then edit it. You could take a screenshot.
      At the moment, it is probably about as useful as a piece of paper and a pencil. But it is a start.

      Although, it does show you some chords, and allows you to pick them out.
      However, there is no theory behind it. So you will have to know what you are doing.

      <br><br>

      I will not make an executable for v0.0.1, if you have found this post somehow, you can go to the GitHub repository and build it yourself.

      <br><br>

      0.1.0 (beta) will exist when I can save and load tracks.
